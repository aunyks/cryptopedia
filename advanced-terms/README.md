# Advanced Cryptocurrency Terminology

* Coinbase Transaction - First transaction in a block. Miners use it so that they can collect their mining reward.

* Block Halving - Reduction of the miner's reward every x blocks. For example, the current bitcoin mining reward is 12.5 bitcoins and is halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years).

* Hash Rate - Speed at which a block is discovered and the math problem is solved.

* Signature - Allows users to prove ownership and transfer ownership of over their coin/s.

* Hash Function - Maps one arbitrarily sized string to some fixed sized string.

* Merkle Tree - A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then continuing to pair and hash the results until a single hash remains the merkle root. in blockchains, merkle tree's are used to maintain security and allow nodes to easily verify transactions and store them.

* ASIC Mining - ASICs, or [A]pplication [S]pecific [I]ntegrated [C]ircuits, are computer chips design to execute one task efficiently and quickly. One example of an ASIC is an ASIC designated only to a certain hashing function. ASIC's have an advantage over regular computer chips. However, some cryptocurrencies are ASIC resistant and ASIC's do not have any advantage over other chips.

* Fork - The creation of an alternative version of the current blockchain. Forks are created when there is a bug, new set of rules, or a 51% attack.
