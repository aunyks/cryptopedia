## Basic Cryptocurrency Terminology

* blockchain => continuously growing database linked and secured using cryptography and economic principles.

* mining => term used for trying to solve a computational-heavy math problem. Whoever solves the math problem first is given a reward and is allowed to create the next block and lengthen the blockchain.

* node => a computer that contains a copy of the blockchain and is trying to create the next block and help secure the blockchain.

* wallet => program that stores your private and public key's and allows you to easily send, receive, and store program.

* altcoin => term describing any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency). They are sometimes called alts.

* block => pages in a notebook or entries in a diary. The data in a block is unable to be changed and (for the most part) is stored permanently.

* Proof of Work => "A system that ties mining capability to computational power."

* whitepaper => document which outlines the problem, solution, product, implementation, and more of a new protocol or currency. you should always look for a whitepaper when new technology in the blockchain space is released so you can quickly get up to speed. 

* Public-key cryptography => cryptographic system in which they are two keys: a public key (can be compared to home address) which is shared with all and a private key (can be compared to password) which is known only to the owner

* public address => compare an x cryptocurrency address to your email address. It is where you store, receive or send your cryptocurrency. Addresses are normally long numbers. You would receive all your x cryptocurrency at your public address.

* fiat currency => currency that is backed by a government but not by anything physical (gold, silver, etc). One example is the Euro.
