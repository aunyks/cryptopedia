## Advanced Cryptocurrency Terminology

* coinbase transaction => first transaction in a block. Miners use it so that they can collect their mining reward

* block halving => reduction of the miner's reward every x blocks. For example, the current bitcoin mining reward is 12.5 bitcoins and is halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years)

* hash rate => speed at which a block is discovered and the math problem is solved.

* signature => allows users to prove ownership and transfer ownership of over their coin/s.

* hash function => maps one arbitrarily sized string to some fixed sized string.

* merkle tree => a tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then continuing to pair and hash the results until a single hash remains the merkle root. in blockchains, merkle tree's are used to maintain security and allow nodes to easily verify transactions and store them.

* asic mining => ASIC's are computer chips design to execute one task efficiently and quickly. One example of an ASIC is an ASIC designated only to a certain hashing function. ASIC's have an advantage over regular computer chips. However, some cryptocurrencies are ASIC resistant and ASIC's do not have any advantage over other chips.

* fork => the creation of an alternative version of the current blockchain. Forks are created when there is a bug, new set of rules, or a 51% attack.
